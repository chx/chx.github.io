<ul><li>Challenge leagues are a great opportunity for a fresh start in a new economy. All of your old characters and items are still present in the Standard and Hardcore leagues, but you're encouraged to join the new leagues, complete challenges and demonstrate your mastery of Path of Exile!</li>
<li>In the Ancestor Challenge League, you'll visit the Karui afterlife and defeat ten tribes in a series of tournaments to earn valuable new rewards.</li>
<li>As you play through the league, you'll find tradeable Silver coins which are used to gain passage to the Karui Afterlife. You'll start out with a basic team of three Karui warriors to enter the Trial of the Ancestors.</li>
<li>In each match, you can select which tribe to compete against, based on the reward offered. You can examine the battlefield configuration of the enemy team and strategically place your warriors to challenge theirs. Then you and your party will compete alongside your warriors to destroy the opposing team's totems and win the match.</li>
<li>When you compete in tournaments, you'll accumulate favour with each of the tribes. This can be spent on recruiting warriors and purchasing field items and equipment to power up your team. Each tribe has their own specialities and you can mix and match warriors from different tribes to build a team that embodies your strategy.</li>
<li>For more information about this expansion, check out pathofexile.com/ancestor</li>
<li>With 3.22.0, there are Standard, Hardcore, Solo Self-Found and Ruthless variations of the Ancestor challenge league available. They have the same core mechanics and items. You can create private league versions of these leagues, with mods that make the game harder.</li>
<li>The new Ancestor challenge league includes a set of 40 new challenges, and 8 new challenges in Ruthless Ancestor. There are microtransaction rewards for completing challenges that are only obtainable in this league. These rewards will be revealed in an upcoming news post.</li>

        <div class="box-content" style="padding: 10px 40px;"><h3>New Content and Features</h3>
<ul><li>Added The Forbidden Sanctum to the core game, with a few adjustments. Please read the Forbidden Sanctum Changes section for more information.</li>
<li>Added a new Strength Support Gem - Controlled Blaze: Supports melee attack skills, providing them with a chance to Ignite. For each Ignite inflicted with the Skill recently, it deals less Damage but more Ignite Damage.</li>
<li>Added a new Strength Support Gem - Corrupting Cry: Supports Warcry Skills, making them inflict corrupted blood on enemies affected by the warcry or by the attacks that it exerts.</li>
<li>Added a new Strength Support Gem - Trauma: Supports strike skills you use yourself, causing you to gain Trauma the first time a Supported Attack Hits an Enemy. Supported Attacks deal added Physical Damage per Trauma, but also make you take Physical Damage per Trauma. Supported Skills can only be used with Axes, Maces, Sceptres or Staves.</li>
<li>Added a new Strength Support Gem - Volatility: Supports attack skills, causing them to deal more Maximum Attack Damage, but less Minimum Attack Damage. Supported Skills also deal increased Damage.</li>
<li>Added a new Strength/Intelligence Support Gem - Flamewood: Supports skills which summon totems, triggering Avenging Flame when a Totem from Supported Skills is Hit by an Enemy. Avenging Flame fires a mortar up in the air, which falls down upon a target, and deals area damage where it lands.</li>
<li>Added a new Strength/Intelligence Support Gem - Guardian's Blessing: Must support both a skill that creates minions which can be damaged, and an aura skill that creates permanent auras around you.

<li>Added a new Intelligence Support Gem - Frigid Bond: Supports Link Skills. Supported Skills Damage and Chill Enemies between you and Linked Targets.</li>
<li>Added a new Intelligence Support Gem - Fresh Meat: Supports skills that create minions. Minions created by Supported Skills gain Wakened Fury and Adrenaline for 10% of their Duration, up to a maximum of 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Added a new Intelligence Support Gem - Sacrifice: Supports spell skills that deal damage with hits and have no reservation. These spells sacrifice a percentage of your current life, to gain additional chaos damage based on how much life was sacrificed. Cannot support orb skills, brand skills, channelling skills, Vaal skills or skills used by traps or mines. Cannot modify the skills of minions.</li>
<li>Added a new Intelligence/Strength Support Gem - Spellblade: Supports spells that hit enemies, causing them to have Added Spell Damage equal to a percentage of Damage of Equipped One Handed Melee Weapons. If two Weapons are Equipped, each contributes 60% as much Added Damage. Cannot modify the skills of minions.</li>
<li>Added a new Intelligence/Dexterity Support Gem - Devour: Supports any skill that hits enemies. Killing Blows from Supported Skills Consume corpses to Recover life and Mana.</li>

        <div class="box-content" style="padding: 10px 40px;"><h3>Forbidden Sanctum Changes</h3>
<ul><li>The Forbidden Sanctum has been added to the core game. You'll initially meet Divinia in the Oriath Docks in Act 10, who provides you with access to the Forbidden Sanctum.</li>
<li>The Forbidden Sanctum has a maximum Area Level of 83.</li>
<li>Introduced Forbidden Tomes, which are tradeable items that are found in the end game. A Forbidden Tome represents the entire first floor of the Forbidden Sanctum, and its rooms can be played back to back.</li>
<li>Upon successfully completing a Sanctum floor, the next floor is generated as a tradable item with the state of your Sanctum built in, including your Boons, Afflictions, Resolve, Relics and Aureus.</li>
<li>Relics have also returned and are now tradeable. They are locked in at the beginning of the first Sanctum floor, and cannot be changed for the remainder of the Sanctum run.</li>
<li>Completing a Forbidden Sanctum run now requires killing Lycia in both her first and second form. She will always drop a Unique Relic, which have also been reworked and replaced as we rebalanced the Forbidden Sanctum.</li>
<li>Primary defences now have some effect on protecting your Resolve. Armour provides Resolve Mitigation from Enemy Hits, Evasion grants a chance to Avoid Resolve loss from Enemy Hits, while Energy Shield provides you with Resolve Aegis, which is a mechanic that behaves similarly to how Energy Shield behaves for Life.</li>
<li>The difficulty of Forbidden Sanctum has been increased, especially in the later floors. Monsters generally have more Life, and deal slightly more Resolve damage.</li>
<li>Rare Monsters can now be found within the Forbidden Sanctum, and completing a room now requires killing all Rare Monsters present.</li>
<li>Monsters in the Forbidden Sanctum are immune to damage if there is no player within 100 units of them.</li>
<li>Boons and Afflictions have been reviewed and rebalanced, and we've also added new Boons and Afflictions themed around the new defensive mechanics.</li>
<li>The Rusted Mallet minor Affliction that causes Monsters to have Knockback has been removed.</li>
<li>Relic modifiers have also been reviewed and rebalanced. We've also added new Relic modifiers for the new defensive mechanics.</li>
<li>We've also added more hazards and room variety to the Forbidden Sanctum.</li>
<li>The Forbidden Sanctum has also been adjusted for Ruthless.</li>

<li>Map tiers and locations have been shuffled (though the 'pin' locations for maps has not changed). Most maps are now initially found at a different tier.</li>
<li>Some of the Map Bosses you are required to defeat to upgrade your Pantheon have changed as a result of these Atlas changes.</li>
<li>Crafting Recipes that were previously unlocked in Maps that have been removed from the Atlas are now found within other Maps currently on the Atlas.</li>
<li>Some Divination Cards have found new homes as a result of these Atlas Changes:</li>
<li>The Scarred Meadow and Tranquillity can now be found in the Orchard Map.</li>
<li>The Whiteout can now be found in the Channel Map.</li>
<li>Unique Maps are no longer offered as a mission when rerolling Kirac's missions with an Explorer's Scouting Report.</li>
<li>The Sextant modifiers that cause the Final Map Boss in each Map to drop an additional Shaper Guardian, Elder Guardian, or Conqueror Map have been changed to drop upon Completing your Maps.</li>
<li>When adding the new Lucid Dreams Keystone Atlas Passive, we also took time to review Vaal Side Areas in Maps and the modifiers present on them.</li>
<li>All modifiers, except one, no longer grant additional packs of Corrupted Vaal Monsters. This has been moved to be an Implicit modifier instead.</li>
<li>Modifiers with upsides no longer have Increased Item Quantity or Item Corruption Chance, unless that is the only thing they do.</li>
<li>Modifiers with downsides no longer have variable Item Corruption Chance. This is now a fixed value relative to the perceived difficulty of the modifier.</li>
<li>Vaal Side Areas can no longer roll regular Map modifiers.</li>
<li>Modifiers that add extra Monsters are now Suffixes.</li>
<li>The Explicit Item Corruption Chance modifier has been removed.</li>
<li>The values provided by modifiers have also been rebalanced.</li>
<li>Added some new modifiers, including one that causes Vaal Vessels to contain an additional Level 21 Corrupted Gem.</li>
<li>Map Bosses in Corrupted Maps no longer have the "Corrupted" tag, and no longer drop additional Vaal items. </li>
<li>The Vaal Temple Map can no longer be obtained outside of Corruption, Vaal Side Areas, or Divination Cards.</li>
<li>The Beastcraft obtained from Einhar's Memory of Harvest Beasts that created a Vaal Temple Map now creates a Synthesis Unique Map.</li>
<li>We've also added 3 new Unique Vaal Side Areas. Happy hunting!</li>
